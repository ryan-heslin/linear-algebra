# My Linear Algebra Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to linear algebra
problems from two textbooks: Otto Bretscher's _Linear Algebra with Applications_
(5th ed.) and Gilbert Strang's _Linear Algebra and Its Applications_ (4th ed.).
I began this repository with problems I did to study for a linear algebra course I took in the spring 2021
semester at American University, but I continued adding to it as I studied the subject on my own.

I did not thoroughly check my answers, and many are probably incorrect, but
mistakes are valuable practice nonetheless. Some of the Rmarkdown files containing my solutions
require my [matador](https://github.com/ryan-heslin/matador) package,
largely to translate `R` matrix objects into LaTeX. PDFs of the solutions are also provided.
