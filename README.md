# My Linear Algebra Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to linear algebra 
problems from two textbooks: Otto Bretscher's _Linear Algebra with Applications_
(5th ed.) and Gilbert Strange _Linear Algebra and Its Applications_ (4th ed.).
Most were done to study for a linear algebra course I took in the spring 2021
semester at American University. 

I did not thoroughly check my answers, and many are probably incorrect, but 
mistakes are valuable practice nonetheless. The .Rmd files containing my solutions
require my [matador](https://github.com/ryan-heslin/matador) package,
largely to translate `R` matrix objects into LaTeX. PDFs of the solutions are also provided.
